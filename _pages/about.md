Hey there, I’m Rishiraj Acharya, just another boring, short, coke dependent, undergraduate Machine Learning Engineer who lives, studies and works in Kolkata, India. You’re probably reading this for my contributions in the tech world, but interesting fact, I didn’t always want to get into tech. I was always a medical aspirant. However, my marks in entrance exams slapped me on my face and said, “you’re made for tech”. I started my tech journey after getting into university and soon explored almost everything: from App Development to Web and from coffee to cookies. Failed in some, lost interest in some but finally I found my love: Machine Learning and chicken wings.

Since then I studied ML extensively focusing on Neural Networks, worked at companies to gain practical ML experience and made sure to utilize my time in helping my peers learn, connect and grow as a community. I was a Microsoft Student Partner, a deeplearning.ai Ambassador, a ML team lead at Google DSC and an active volunteer for Google Developer Groups Kolkata. I love taking sessions and speaking at various conferences for promoting student knowledge on developer products and platforms. I also taught Python to students during the pandemic as a facilitator at Stanford University.

These were some things that you can find about me on the internet, want a secret? I’m a national level Chess player, a swimming champion and I can lecture for hours on the outer reaches of space and the craziness of astrophysics.
